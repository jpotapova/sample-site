### Technology choices

#### Worflow automation

Grunt was chosen for workflow automation, as it is a very simple static website.
To speed up development process grunt was configured to open the browser, serve static website and perform live reload on src file changes.
Grunt was also used to do all the file pre-processing, such as compiling scss code, bundling javascript etc.
For production mode grunt is used to perfom bundling and minification.

#### CSS
Sass with scss syntax was used to write css. BEM was chosen as a convention. CSS was written with a mobile-first approach. Sass linting was configured with grunt.

#### JS
It was decided to write javascript code in vanilla javascript and not to use any frameworks, because there is very little javascript functionality needed and there werenâ€™t any major issues with cross-browser compatibility. Javascript was linted with jshint grunt plugin.
